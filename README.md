# Transforming JSON Data in Python

This library is the basis for a data transformation algebra: We want a succinct way of transforming data in Python. We want operations on data to result in yet more data. We do not want data operations to raise exceptions. This library is solves Python's lack of consistency (lack of closure) under the dot (`.`) and slice `[::]` operators when operating on data objects.
